During my visit of Prof. Jan-Philip Solovej and the
[QMath](https://qmath.ku.dk/about/) people in Copenhagen, I gave a
[talk](https://github.com/rauchrob/slides-quantum-lunch-2019/releases/download/v1.0/slides.pdf)
at the Quantum Lunch seminar presenting some applications of the
orthogonalization of fermion k-body operators.

# Abstract
The N-representability problem is a long-standing open problem in quantum
chemistry and has regained attention by groundbreaking results on the more
general quantum marginal problem of quantum information theory over the last
two decades. In this talk, we briefly review general representability problems
for finite-dimensional fermion systems from a geometric viewpoint. The central
object of interest is the k-body reduction of the fermion many-particle state.
Based on recent results on the orthogonalization of fermion k-body operators,
we will present new relations between the k-body reduction and the traditional
reduced density matrices.
